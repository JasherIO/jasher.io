Rocket League Esports broke new ground yesterday. 

The next season of RLCS features a million dollar prize pool, doubling last season's pool, 


Million dollar prize pool, up from last season's half a million pool

An additional 100K to Rival Series

The current [rules](https://www.rocketleagueesports.com/rules/) point to the league keeping the same format and regions as last season.

Goal differential replaces win percentage as the first tiebreaker.

Rosters are locked July 30th for RLCS and August 5th for Rival Series. Expect to see roster announcements between now and then.

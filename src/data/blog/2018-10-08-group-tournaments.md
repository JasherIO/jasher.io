A [group tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament#Group_tournaments) is a round-based competition. Each round entrants play head-to-head fixtures. Results rank entrants, where draws are resolved using [tiebreakers](). The rankings represent an accurate placement of entrant skill at the conclusion of the final round. 

# Round-Robin

Entrants play each other an equal number of times in a [round-robin tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament). It is a common format that can be found in both sports and esports. For example, the *Rocket League Championship Series* uses a single round-robin for [league play](https://smash.gg/tournament/rlcs-season-4/events/na-rlcs/brackets/150287) and the *NFL* uses double round-robin for [divisional play](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_regular_season#Scheduling_formula). 

# Swiss

A [Swiss tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament) pairs entrants together every round according to current standings.

Due to pairing, a Swiss tournament requires less fixtures than a round-robin.

### Pairing Rules

### Number of Rounds

4 entrants — 2 rounds
8 entrants — 3 rounds
16 entrants — 4 rounds
32 entrants — 5 rounds
64 entrants — 6 rounds

> For the math nerds, the suggested minimum number of rounds is log₂(number of entrants).

**Entrants**: 4–64

### Pros

* Entrants are guaranteed a number of fixtures.
* Entrants are not immediately eliminated upon a loss.
* Entrants are rewarded for consistent results.
* A well selected prioritized list of tiebreakers results in an accurate final ranking.

### Cons

* (Round-robin) The total number of rounds increases as the number of entrants increase. 
  * This can be mitigated by splitting entrants into smaller groups (See the [2018 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup)).
* A poor selection of tiebreakers leads to a poor ranking of entrants. 
* (Swiss) A poor selection of tiebreakers results in poor pairings.
* Entrant(s) that leave early give another entrant(s) a free fixture win. Multiple disqualifications skew standings and pairings.
* Entrants lose interest in fixtures that do not affect standings.

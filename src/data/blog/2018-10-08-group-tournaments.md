A [group tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament#Group_tournaments) is a round-based competition. Each round entrants play head-to-head fixtures. Then, entrants are ranked by fixture results, where draws are resolved using [tiebreakers](https://jasher.io/tiebreakers/). Final standings represent an accurate ranking of entrants.

# Round-Robin

In a [round-robin tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament) all entrants play each other an equal number of times.

For example, in a single round-robin tournament, entrants play each other once and in a double round-robin tournament, they play each other twice.

Round

Fixture 1

Fixture 2

1

A vs B

C vs D

2

A vs C

B vs D

3

A vs D

B vs C

4 Entrants - 3 Rounds
8 Entrants - 7 Rounds
16 Entrants - 15 Rounds

As the number of entrants increases, the number of rounds increases and, thus, the tournament duration increases. Therefore, an organizer should be mindful of their time constraints when deciding the number of entrants in a group.

**Entrants**: 4–8

**Examples**: [RLCS Season 4 League Play](https://smash.gg/tournament/rlcs-season-4/events/na-rlcs/brackets/150287), [CONCACAF Hexagonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_(CONCACAF)#Fifth_round)

# Swiss

A [Swiss tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament) pairs entrants together every round according to current standings.

Due to pairing, a Swiss tournament requires less fixtures than a round-robin.

### Pairing Rules

### Number of Rounds

4 entrants — 2 rounds
8 entrants — 3 rounds
16 entrants — 4 rounds
32 entrants — 5 rounds
64 entrants — 6 rounds

> For the math nerds, the suggested minimum number of rounds is log₂(number of entrants).

**Entrants**: 4–64

### Pros

* Entrants are guaranteed a number of fixtures.
* Entrants are not immediately eliminated upon a loss.
* Entrants are rewarded for consistent results.
* A well selected prioritized list of tiebreakers will result in an accurate ranking of teams.

### Cons

* A poor selection of tiebreakers leads to a poor ranking of entrants. In Swiss, it also results in poor pairings.
* Entrant(s) that leave early give another entrant(s) a free fixture win. Multiple disqualifications will significantly skew standings and pairings.
* Entrants lose interest in fixtures that do not affect standings.

* Ranks: Mininum and Maximum
* Permissions: Public and Private events

*Tournaments* will be released in March or April with the [Spring feature update](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-league-roadmap-spring-2018/). 
# Quality-of-Life Features
In addition to the new *Tournaments* feature, the beta also included multiple new Quality-of-Life features:

* Primary color options have been expanded.

* Network settings (client send rate, server send rate, and bandwith limit) can be adjusted in-game.

* Match notifications (time updates and kickoffs) can be enabled or disabled.  

*Notice: The above is a list of prominent features and should not be considered comprehensive.*

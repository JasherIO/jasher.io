As an administrator and broadcast assistant for *Rocket League* events since Summer 2016, it hurts when I see broadcasters make common mistakes that are avoidable with the proper information.

# Before Game

* Appear offline on *Steam*
   1. Open the *Steam* friend list
   2. Click the arrow next to your username
   3. Select **Offline**
* Enable background audio
   1. [Instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/3hahmq/psa_how_to_enable_background_audio/)
* Disable camera shake
   1. Click **Options**
   2. Click **Camera**
   3. Uncheck **Camera Shake**
* Disable in-game chat
   1. Click **Options**
   2. Switch **Text Chat** to **Disabled**
* Set UI Scale to 100%
   1. TODO

# Server Creation

From the main menu, navigate to the Create Private Match screen (see below): 

1. Click **Play**
2. Click **Private Match**
3. Click **Create Private Match**

Most of the options here are pretty self explanatory. We'll highlight several that require further description:

* The **Team Size** option only matters for bot matches. There are always 10 slots in a lobby (8 are usable for players). Fill empty slots to avoid joins by third parties. 
* Set the **Bot Difficulty** to "No Bots"
* Set team names and colors under **Team Settings** (optional)
  * Match team colors to logos (ex. Cloud9 as Blue team and NRG as Orange team)
  * Remember to update these values between matches
* For soccar matches, restore mutators to the defaults settings
  1. Click **Mutator Settings**
  2. Click **Restore Defaults**
* Set the **Joinable By** option to "Name/Password"
  * Choose a unique name and password (i.e. not easily guessable)
* Once the lobby has been created, verify the server region
  1. Click **Spectate**
  2. View the scoreboard (Tab on keyboard)
  3. Verify that the server name (top-left) begins with the correct region acronym 

# Cameras

There are 4 cameras for spectating *Rocket League*: 

1. **Player**: shows exactly what a player sees
2. **Fly**: allows for manual movement around the arena (similar to [SkyCam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNtNBNoVFHI))
3. **Auto**: operates as an automated fly cam, seamlessly moving around the arena and following the action
4. **Director**: automated system that uses both player cam and auto cam to follow the action

Spectator was first introduced in August 2015 in [Patch v1.04](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/patch-notes-v1-15--pc-ps4-/). 

Player cam does not show team build-up or team positioning well.

Fly cam is unused in a live environment. 

Autocam debuted in [Patch v1.15](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/patch-notes-v1-15--pc-ps4-/).

Director mode was added in [Patch v1.37](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/patch-notes-v1-37/).

* Hide unnecessary HUD elements
   1. Click **Spectate**
   2. Hit the **H** key once

# Post-Game
 
After a game is finished, you have 45 seconds before the next game begins. Time is limited so prioritize any actions you take. 

* Save the replay (optional)
  * Name the replay according to the teams playing, game number, etc.
* Make lobby changes (optional)
  1. Click **Match Settings**
  2. Change Game Mode, Arena, etc. as required

Network issues can lead to players asking for a **server recreation**. When recreating a lobby make sure you use a *new* and *unique* name to avoid **split lobbies**.

> Lobby A is created with "Name - Password." Players are still in Lobby A when Lobby B is created with "Name - Password." Now, there are two lobbies with the same information. Players could join either Lobby A or B.

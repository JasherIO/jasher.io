These guidelines were made to help broadcasters avoid common mistakes when streaming *Rocket League*.

## Server Creation

From the main menu, navigate to the Create Private Match screen (see below): 

1. Click **Play**
2. Click **Private Match**
3. Click **Create Private Match**

Most of the options here are pretty self explanatory. We'll highlight several that require further description:

* The **Team Size** option only matters for bot matches. There are always 10 slots in a lobby (8 are usable for players). Fill empty slots to avoid joins by third parties. 
* Set the **Bot Difficulty** to "No Bots"
* Set team names and colors under **Team Settings** (optional)
  * Remember to update these values between matches
* For soccar matches, restore mutators to the defaults settings
  1. Click **Mutator Settings**
  2. Click **Restore Defaults**
* Set the **Joinable By** option to "Name/Password"
  * Choose a unique name and password
  * Your name and password should not be easily guessable
* Once the lobby has been created, verify the server region
  1. Click **Spectate**
  2. View the scoreboard (Tab on keyboard)
  3. Verify that the server name (top-left) begins with the correct region acronym 

## Spectating

* Disable camera shake
   1. Click **Options**
   2. Click **Camera**
   3. Uncheck **Camera Shake**
* Appear offline on Steam
   * If the display is captured, Steam friend request notifications broadcast to the stream. Appearing offline avoids this issue. 
* Hide unnecessary HUD elements
   1. Click **Spectate**
   2. Hit the **H** key

#### Cameras

There are 4 ways to spectate *Rocket League*: 

1. Player
   * Shows exactly what a player sees
   * Is not the optimal way to show team build-up and plays
   * Rendered obsolete after the release of director cam
2. Fly
   * Free movement around the arena
   * Not used in a live environment
3. Autocam
   * 
4. Director
   * 

## After Game
 
* Save the replay (optional)
  * Name the replay according to the teams playing, game number, etc.
* Make lobby changes (optional)
  1. Click **Match Settings**
  2. Change Game Mode, Arena, etc. as required
* Players may request a server recreation. Make sure you use a *new* and *unique* name to avoid **split lobbies**.
  * Split lobbies: Lobby A is created with "Name - Password." Players are still in Lobby A when Lobby B is created with "Name - Password." Now, there are two lobbies with the same information. Players could join either Lobby A or B.

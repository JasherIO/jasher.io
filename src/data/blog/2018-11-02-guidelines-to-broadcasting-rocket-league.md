Most of the options here are pretty self explanatory. We'll highlight several that require further description:

* The **Team Size** option only matters for bot matches. There are always 10 slots in a lobby (8 are usable for players). Fill empty slots to avoid joins by third parties. 
* Set the **Bot Difficulty** to "No Bots"
* Set team names and colors under **Team Settings** (optional)
  * Remember to update these values between matches
* For soccar matches, restore mutators to the defaults settings
  1. Click **Mutator Settings**
  2. Click **Restore Defaults**
* Set the **Joinable By** option to "Name/Password"
  * Choose a unique name and password (i.e. not easily guessable)
* Once the lobby has been created, verify the server region
  1. Click **Spectate**
  2. View the scoreboard (Tab on keyboard)
  3. Verify that the server name (top-left) begins with the correct region acronym 

# Cameras

There are 4 ways to spectate *Rocket League*: 

1. **Player**: shows exactly what a player sees
2. **Fly**: allows for manual movement around the arena (similar to [SkyCam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNtNBNoVFHI))
3. **Auto**: operates as an automated fly cam, seamlessly moving around the arena and following the action
4. **Director**: automated system that uses both player cam and auto cam to follow the action

Spectator was first introduced in August 2015 in [Patch v1.04](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/patch-notes-v1-15--pc-ps4-/). 


Player cam does not show team build-up or team positioning well.

Fly cam is unused in a live environment. 

* Hide unnecessary HUD elements
   1. Click **Spectate**
   2. Hit the **H** key once

# After Game
 
* Save the replay (optional)
  * Name the replay according to the teams playing, game number, etc.
* Make lobby changes (optional)
  1. Click **Match Settings**
  2. Change Game Mode, Arena, etc. as required
* Players may request a server recreation. Make sure you use a *new* and *unique* name to avoid **split lobbies**.
  * Split lobbies: Lobby A is created with "Name - Password." Players are still in Lobby A when Lobby B is created with "Name - Password." Now, there are two lobbies with the same information. Players could join either Lobby A or B.

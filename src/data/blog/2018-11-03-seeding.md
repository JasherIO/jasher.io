# What is a seed?

> A seed  is a competitor or team in a sport or other tournament who is given a preliminary ranking for the purposes of the draw. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_(sports))

In other words, teams are ranked based on their skill so that the "best" team plays the "worst" team of every round. 

# Why should a tournament be seeded? 

> Players/teams are "planted" into the bracket in a manner that is typically intended so that the best do not meet until later in the competition. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_(sports))

A tournament is a meant to be a credible competitive venture. The "best" entrants should be competing against each other at the end of the tournament for the prize pool.

# How do you seed a tournament? 

A seed is simply a ranking of an entrant. So, the process of seeding a tournament is simply the process of ranking the entrants of the tournament.

# How do you rank a group of entrants?

Historical fixture results and entrant statisitics represent a natural predictor\nfor an entrant's success in a competition. For example, the [Rocket League Community Power Rankings Committee](https://twitter.com/RLPowerRankings) ranks the top regional teams in Europe, North America, and Oceania according to recent fixture results. For entrants outside verified rankings, it is best to research and compare recent results via\nreputable data sources: [Liquipedia](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/rocketleague/), [Octane](http://octane.gg/).

# How does inaccurate seeding affect a tournament?

NRG, Iris, and Atelier were 3 of the best teams in North American Rocket League at the time of the tournament below. NRG and Atelier were seeded 1 and 2 respectively, while Iris was placed 8th. Due to Iris' seed, they faced another top 3 team (NRG) in the quarterfinals instead of the semifinals.

While it may seem like a small difference, often the quarterfinals and semifinals differ in fixture format (ex. best-of-3 to best-of-5). Production schedules vary by organizations, but there are organizations known to stream the semifinals and up, which means they would have missed one of the most competitive matches of the tournament. Lastly, a match between 2 of the top teams in a tournament is more dramatic when it is played as close to the conclusion of the tournament as possible. Hence, accurate seeding results in a competitive and entertaining tournament.

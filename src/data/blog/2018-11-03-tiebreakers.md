In the picture above, you’ll see that Method and PSG eSports are tied at first with 6–1 records. To resolve the fixture tie, we first look at their game win percentage. Method won 71.46% of their games and PSG won 63.33% of their games. Method's game win percentage was better, so we stop progressing through the list of tiebreakers and award them 1st place. Similarly, Flipsid3 Tactics acquires 6th place by having a better game win percentage than Team Envy.

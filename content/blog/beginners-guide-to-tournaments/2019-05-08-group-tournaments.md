A [group tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament#Group_tournaments) is a competition where entrants play head-to-head fixtures over successive rounds. Results rank entrants, where draws are resolved using [tiebreakers](). The rankings represent an accurate placement of entrant skill at the conclusion of the final round.

## Round-Robin

Entrants play each other an equal number of times in a [round-robin tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament).
It is a common format that can be found in both sports and esports. For example, the _Rocket League Championship Series_ uses a single round-robin for [league play](https://smash.gg/tournament/rlcs-season-4/events/na-rlcs/brackets/150287) and the _NFL_ uses double round-robin for [divisional play](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_regular_season#Scheduling_formula).

## Swiss

A [Swiss tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament) pairs entrants together every round according to current standings.

Due to pairing, a Swiss tournament requires less fixtures than a round-robin.

The suggested minimum number of rounds is log₂(number of entrants).
[Swiss Triangle](http://swisstriangle.net) calculates the minimum number of rounds and visualizes the Swiss format.

### Pros

- Entrants are guaranteed a number of fixtures.
- Entrants are not immediately eliminated upon a loss.
- Entrants are rewarded for consistent results.
- A well selected prioritized list of tiebreakers results in an accurate final ranking.

### Cons

- (Round-robin) The total number of rounds increases as the number of entrants increase. _ This can be mitigated by splitting entrants into smaller groups (See the [2018 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup))._ A poor selection of tiebreakers leads to a poor ranking of entrants. \* (Swiss) A poor selection of tiebreakers results in poor pairings.
- Entrant(s) that leave early give another entrant(s) a free fixture win. Multiple disqualifications skew standings and pairings.
- Entrants lose interest in fixtures that do not affect standings.

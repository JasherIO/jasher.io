On Wednesday, Psyonix announced that they, and Rocket League, are being [purchased by Epic Games](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/psyonix-is-joining-the-epic-family-/). The acquisition will see Rocket League move to the Epic Store by the end of the year.

Following the announcement, Psyonix [tweeted](https://twitter.com/RocketLeague/status/1123736400715747330) about future Steam support:

> Hi all! We wanted to clarify something for you after today’s news: Rocket League is and remains available on Steam. Anyone who owns Rocket League through Steam can still play it and can look forward to continued support. Thanks!

In regards to esports, Psyonix states that "this is a great move for the Rocket League Esports ecosystem because it significantly increases our potential reach and resources, just like it does for the game itself." Andrew Hayward, of The Esports Observer, discusses the potential [impact of the acquisition on the Rocket League esports scene](https://esportsobserver.com/rocket-league-esports-opinion/).

The final week of **Championship Series** League Play takes place Saturday and Sunday. In North America, NRG, G2, and Cloud9 are fighting over the Top 3. Meanwhile, Evil Geniuses, Ghost Gaming, and Rogue are attempting to make Top 6 and the Regional Championship. One of the three joins Splyce in the Promotional Playoffs.

Vitality swept aside PSG, FC Barcelona, Dignitas, The Bricks, and TSM in the first three weeks, putting them comfortably in the drivers seat of European play. PSG, FC Barcelona, TSM, and Triple Trouble are vieing for 2nd, while Dignitas, The Bricks, and Mousesports are looking to avoid the Promotional Playoffs.

The European and North American Regional Championship feature a new ["page playoffs" format](https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeagueEsports/comments/bi22z2/new_regional_championship_format_much_more_fair/) this season. With the new format, the 3rd and 4th place teams have to lose twice to be eliminated. Previously, 3rd played 6th and 4th played 5th in elimination matches.

All 8 spots are up for grabs in the **Oceanic Masters** with 2 weeks remaining. The Top 4 move onto the Regional Finals, wherein the top 2 advance to the World Championship.

Erodium, INTZ, Lotus, and Lowkey have clinched spots in the Regional Championship after 4 weeks of **Grand Series** play. FantasyDeath, Gfactor Galaxy, Orchid, and Team CryptiK are competing for the final 2 spots.

Psyonix announced in Week 1 that the New Jersey Devils' Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey will host the [**World Championship**](https://www.rocketleagueesports.com/news/rlcs-season-7-world-championship-headed-to-the-east-coast/). The World Championship features 12 teams after the addition of South America to RLCS. Those 12 teams compete in a new [group stage format](https://twitter.com/LiquipediaRL/status/1122254474024714241), a first at the World Championship.

Teams are competing in **Rival Series** Week 4 at the time of writing, so make sure to check out the latest results from [Europe](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Rocket_League_Championship_Series/Season_7/Europe/Rocket_League_Rival_Series) and [North America](https://liquipedia.net/rocketleague/Rocket_League_Championship_Series/Season_7/North_America/Rocket_League_Rival_Series).
